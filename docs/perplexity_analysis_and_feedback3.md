# okay tell me where to publish this. I am not in university or anything.

You can publish your work as an independent researcher by utilizing open-access journals, preprint archives, and community-run platforms that welcome submissions from non-university-affiliated authors. Here are the leading options:[^1][^2]

### Preprint Archives

- **arXiv.org**: Widely used for mathematics and physics, accepts submissions from independent researchers. Posting here gives visibility and a citable link for your work, and it's free and open to all.[^2][^3]


### Open Access and Peer-Reviewed Journals

- **PLOS Complex Systems**: Accepts broad research in complex systems, including nonlinearity, modeling, and theoretical frameworks, and is open to submissions from the global research community.[^4][^5]
- **Complex Systems Journal**:  Covers theoretical and applied research on complex systems, and is open to independent contributors.[^6]
- **MSP Journals (Mathematical Sciences Publishers)**: Offers open-access models in high-quality math journals, you submit via their author portal. No university affiliation is required, only strong research.[^7]
- **Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS)**: Peer-reviewed, free to authors and readers, especially welcoming to new research in complex systems regardless of institutional affiliation.[^8]
- **London Mathematical Society Journals**: Respectable and peer-reviewed, and have broad scopes in mathematics and nonlinear dynamics; submissions are largely evaluated on content, not author's affiliation.[^9]


### Other Venues

- **SSRN Mathematics Research Network**: Hosts open-access preprints for mathematics and other disciplines, increasing visibility for independent research.[^10]

***

You do not need to be affiliated with a university to be published in any of the above venues, as long as your work meets their standards for quality and originality. Posting to arXiv or SSRN can also help establish a track record and receive feedback before pursuing more formal peer review.[^9][^1]
