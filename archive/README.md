# Archived MCIK Algorithm Examples

This directory contains archived Python scripts and generated GIFs that serve as usage examples and proofs for the MCIK algorithm. These files demonstrate various aspects of the lattice visualization and analysis capabilities.

## Files and Descriptions

### Python Scripts (`*.py`)

- **`1dlatticevisualization.py`**: A script to visualize the behavior of a 1D lattice, showing the propagation of influences over time.
- **`1dlatticevis2ndorder.py`**: An advanced visualization for a 1D lattice, focusing on second-order effects and interactions between lattice points.
- **`2dlatticerealestate.py`**: A script that applies the MCIK algorithm to a 2D lattice, using a real estate dataset as a model for influence propagation.
- **`realestateAnalyzer.py`**: A tool for analyzing the results of the 2D real estate lattice simulation, likely calculating metrics and generating plots.

### Animations (`*.gif`)

- **`real_estate_ripple_animation.gif`**: An animation showing the ripple effect of a perturbation across the 2D real estate lattice.
- **`real_estate_ripple_2D_animation.gif`**: A 2D visualization of the influence spread in the real estate model.

## Usage

To run these examples, you may need to install dependencies such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.
